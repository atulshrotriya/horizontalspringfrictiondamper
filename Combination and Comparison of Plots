After the solution has been achieved through function and simulink, the values are stored in the workspace.
Two new matrices are created in the workspace with the name ans and out.
These correspond to time and position values from function and simulink respectively.
The following MATLAB command can be given for plotting time and position from both methods on the same plot for comparison:
plot(out.simu(:,1),out.simu(:,2),'r',ans(:,1),ans(:,2),'b:','linewidth',2)
